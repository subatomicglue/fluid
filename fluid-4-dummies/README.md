# Mike Ash's fluid simulation for Dummies follows Stam's methods

(This is circa 2006 or so...)

Based on Jos Stam's paper Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games - http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf

You can also read all about how to parallelize the simulation and render the output in 3D in Mike's Master's thesis - http://www.mikeash.com/?page=thesis/
