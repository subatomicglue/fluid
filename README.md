# collection of realtime fluidsim code demos...

This is basically my personal sandbox to play with 2D and 3D realtime fluid dynamics capable of rendering incompressable liquids like water (and secondarily fire/smoke).

Feel free to open Issue tracker with suggestions on other useful code demos, and I'll collect here!

- google's **liquidfun** (2D, works, tested in MacOSX 10.13)
- Mike Ash's **fluid-4-dummies** (3D, lacks a renderer, or main.cpp)
- surajiyer's **FluidSim** - Fluid simulation in C++ based on "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam (3D, missing some dependencies like Eigen, OGL, Tools, etc. Win32/VC++ only)
