# collection of realtime fluidsim code demos...

This is a collection of 2D and 3D realtime fluid dynamics code demos which are capable of simulating & rendering incompressable liquids like water (and secondarily fire/smoke).

Feel free to open Issue tracker with suggestions on other useful code demos, and I'll collect here!

- google's [liquidfun](liquidfun) (2D, works, tested in MacOSX 10.13)
- Mike Ash's [fluid-4-dummies](fluid-4-dummies) (3D, lacks a renderer, or main.cpp)
- surajiyer's [FluidSim](FluidSim) - Fluid simulation in C++ based on "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam (3D, missing some dependencies like Eigen, OGL, Tools, etc. Win32/VC++ only)
