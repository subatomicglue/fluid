# Fluid simulation in C++ based on "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam

Clone of https://github.com/surajiyer/Fluid-Simulation

- some missing stuff here:
  - Eigen (which hopefully is this: https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror)
  - WindowWin32
  - OpenGLBase
  - Tools directories.

And seems to work in win32 only (visual studio project file, and win32 renderer)
